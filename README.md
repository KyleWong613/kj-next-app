This is My Portfolio built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

First, install packages
npm i

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

If development server does not run, upgrade your Node version

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
